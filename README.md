1.Power The NODEMCU and it will act as a router and enables the wifi,i named the wifi as Smart Circuit,you can also rename the wifi credentials.
2.Connect To the Smart Circuit Wifi through the password you set on your code,in my case the password is 12345678
3.Now open the Broswer and enter the IP address as 192.168.1.1 because i initiated the server with this IP address,you can also change this IP address as of your convinience,i used this because it is home IP address to remember.
4.Now you can see tge WebPage with controllables to controll the smart circuit,and you can controll your devices through this website.

#Circuit_Setup
After connecting the nodemcu and relay,in my case i used two channel relay just for this prototpe,you can use whatever relay according to your switch board requirements,either 4 channel realy, or 12 and 24 channel relay mmodules are available in the markets.
Then connect this smart circuit realy with the already existing switch board just same as the switch connect in the board,thats it.Now you ready to controll your device from your Mobile.
